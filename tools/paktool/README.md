# Pak Tools

**Pak Tools** is a set of utilities for managing and manipulating `.pak` files used in the **Imperivm GBR** game. These `.pak` files function as archives that can store any type of file.

The file is structured with an header, followed by a table of contents and the actual files. The table of contents contains information about each file, including its path, size, and offset within the archive.

## Header

* The first **16 bytes** represent the file magic:

  ```
  "HMMSYS PackFile\n"
  ```

* This is followed by a constant 16-byte header:

  ```
  1A 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
  ```

* Then:

  * **4 bytes**: Number of files (little-endian).
  * **4 bytes**: Header length.

## File Path Decoding

File paths are decoded using a shared buffer that is reused across multiple entries. This allows efficient storage by only writing the parts of the path that change between files.

Each file entry specifies a slice of the buffer to overwrite:

1. Two bytes are read:  
   - **Low index**: Start position in the buffer  
   - **High index**: End position in the buffer

2. The next `(high - low)` bytes are read and inserted into the buffer at the given range.

3. The file path is then reconstructed by reading the buffer from the beginning up to the **high index**.

#### Example

- **File 1**
  - Indexes: `0 → 19`  
  - Data: `testfolder/test.txt`  
  - Resulting path: `testfolder/test.txt`

- **File 2**
  - Indexes: `19 → 11`  
  - Data: `ciao.txt`  
  - Buffer becomes: `testfolder/ciao.txt`  
  - Resulting path: `testfolder/ciao.txt`

> **Note:** Only the filename changes, while the folder prefix (`testfolder/`) is preserved from the previous buffer state.

### File Entry Format

Each file entry in the archive contains:

| Bytes   | Description                           |
|---------|---------------------------------------|
| 1 byte  | **High index** (end of insert range)  |
| 1 byte  | **Low index** (start of insert range) |
| N bytes | **File path segment** (ASCII)         |
| 4 bytes | **File offset** within the archive    |
| 4 bytes | **File size** in bytes                |


* This is then followed by the file contents, as referenced in the file table.


## Extraction

To extract all `.pak` files from the game:

```bash
tools/paktool/extractPakFromGame.sh path_to_game_root
```

This script will automatically extract all `.pak` files found in:

* `path_to_game_root/Packs`
* `path_to_game_root/local`


To extract a single `.pak` file manually:

```bash
python3 extractPak.py path_to_pak output_folder
```

**Example:**

```bash
python3 extractPak.py "game_path/Packs/UI.pak" "assets/Packs/UI"
```

## Packing

Repacking `.pak` files can be attempted using the same script, but be aware:

> Note: Although the packed files can be correctly unpacked, the game crashes when loading them, hinting at a potential issue with the packing process.

To pack a folder into a `.pak` file:

```bash
python3 extractPak.py input_folder output_file.pak
```
